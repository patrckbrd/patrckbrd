## Brief Introduction

I am a career shifter transitioning into cybersecurity, bringing years of experience in banking and finance. My background has trained me to analyze complex problems while developing a strong sense of integrity. I have completed a 370+ hour cybersecurity bootcamp at Springboard, where I worked on technical labs, hands-on projects, and received 1-on-1 mentorship. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated on emerging threats and industry best practices. I am seeking an entry-level role in Security Operations Center (SOC), Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Helpdesk support. 


## Capstone Project - Penetration Testing and Security Assessment: A Structured Walkthrough of Artemis Inc.

## Introduction 
This capstone project simulates a real-world cybersecurity scenario. As a student, my task was to conduct a "structured walkthrough" penetration test of a fictional company, Artemis, Inc. A structured walkthrough is a method used by a group of peers to review and discuss the technical aspects of IT in general, IT security, and IT audit work products. Also, a structured walkthrough's main objectives are to identify errors and to improve the quality of the product, services, and ensure the safety of the organization's IT environment.
