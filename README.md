## Brief Introduction

I am a career shifter transitioning into cybersecurity, bringing years of experience in banking and finance. My background has trained me to analyze complex problems while developing a strong sense of integrity. I have completed a 370+ hour cybersecurity bootcamp at Springboard, where I worked on technical labs, hands-on projects, and received 1-on-1 mentorship. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated on emerging threats and industry best practices. I am seeking an entry-level role in Security Operations Center (SOC), Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Helpdesk support. 


## Capstone Project - Penetration Testing and Security Assessment: A Structured Walkthrough of Artemis Inc.

## Introduction 
This capstone project simulates a real-world cybersecurity scenario. As a student, my task was to conduct a "structured walkthrough" penetration test of a fictional company, Artemis, Inc. A structured walkthrough is a method used by a group of peers to review and discuss the technical aspects of IT in general, IT security, and IT audit work products. Also, a structured walkthrough's main objectives are to identify errors and to improve the quality of the product, services, and ensure the safety of the organization's IT environment. 
## Phase 1
In this phase, active reconnaissance is recommended, as Artemis provided explicit permission to thoroughly investigate their IT environment. They shared important details about their technology stack including their current Network Infrastructure, Cloud and On-prem Hosting, Identity and Access Management (IAM), Enterprise Applications, and Proprietary/Internal Applications.

I also recommended conducting passive reconnaissance using OSINT tools to gather publicly available info such as email addresses, phone numbers, resumes and other relevant data.  The research will be mainly focused on social media, search engines, job boards, company research, domain and IP research and Pastebins archive. It is essential to use at least 10 to 15 tools/research sites to provide a critical analysis of Artemis's internet presence and infrastructure/network.
