## Brief Introduction

I am a career shifter transitioning into cybersecurity, bringing years of experience in banking and finance. My background has trained me to analyze complex problems while developing a strong sense of integrity. I have completed a 370+ hour cybersecurity bootcamp at Springboard, where I worked on technical labs, hands-on projects, and received 1-on-1 mentorship. I am committed to continuous learning and staying updated on emerging threats and industry best practices. I am seeking an entry-level role in Security Operations Center (SOC), Identity and Access Management (IAM), and Helpdesk support.
